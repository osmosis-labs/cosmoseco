# Cosmos Menu

## Explore the Cosmos

The official [Cosmos Menu](https://cosmos-menu-15cf62f9744e4a7cce5bcfb140.webflow.io/), pioneered by Osmosis Labs, aims to be *the* go-to landing page for navigating the Cosmos Ecosystem; a one-stop-shop for high-level information about all projects (Appchains, dApps, utilities, etc.) relevant to any of the Cosmos SDK-based blockchains; i.e., the Interchain/Cosmos Ecosystem.

## Exhibit your Project

We encourage any project, live or soon upcoming, to register their project to the Menu so others can learn more about the ecosystem and about your project. Basic metadata, like a name, description, website, social following and/or contact data, and appropriate keywords should suffice for registration. See the project schema and example below for guidance on registration.
